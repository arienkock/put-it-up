# Test Stability and Coverage Improvements

## Summary
This document outlines the improvements made to test stability, test coverage, and CI/CD infrastructure for the sticky-collab project.

## Test Coverage Improvements

### New Unit Tests Added (27 new tests)

#### Board.js Tests
Added comprehensive unit tests for previously untested methods:

1. **`getStickySafe()`**
   - Returns undefined for non-existent stickies
   - Returns sticky object for existing stickies

2. **`deleteSticky()`**
   - Properly removes stickies from the board
   - Makes sticky inaccessible after deletion

3. **`updateColor()`**
   - Changes sticky color correctly
   - Handles multiple color updates

4. **`getState()` and `setState()`**
   - Preserves complete board state including stickies
   - Properly restores state to a new board instance
   - Maintains sticky properties (text, location, color)

5. **`getBoardSize()`**
   - Returns correct width and height dimensions
   - Verifies default board size (2400x1350)

6. **`getOrigin()`**
   - Returns correct board origin coordinates
   - Verifies default origin (0, 0)

7. **`changeSize()`**
   - Increases board dimensions when growing right/bottom
   - Modifies origin when growing top/left
   - Properly handles growth increments (100px)

8. **Text Handling**
   - Removes newlines from text input
   - Handles empty/null text gracefully
   - Preserves text content through updates

9. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Snaps negative coordinates to origin
   - Snaps coordinates exceeding board limits
   - Enforces board boundaries correctly

#### LocalDatastore.js Tests
Added comprehensive tests for observer pattern and data management:

1. **Observer Notifications**
   - Notifies observers when sticky is created
   - Notifies observers when sticky text is updated
   - Notifies observers when sticky color is updated
   - Notifies observers when sticky location is updated
   - Notifies observers when sticky is deleted
   - Notifies observers when board is updated
   - Supports multiple observers

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Returns default values when board is undefined
   - Returns cloned data to prevent mutations
   - `getState()` returns isolated state copies
   - `setState()` restores state and notifies observers

3. **ID Management**
   - Properly increments ID generator
   - Maintains unique IDs for stickies

4. **API Coverage**
   - `isReadyForUse()` always returns true

## Test Stability Improvements

### Reduced Test Timeout
- **Before:** 95,000ms (95 seconds)
- **After:** 60,000ms (60 seconds)
- **Rationale:** Excessively long timeouts masked test stability issues. The reduced timeout encourages fixing flaky tests rather than waiting longer.

### Removed Arbitrary Timeouts
- Removed hardcoded `999999` timeout from "creates new sticky close to mouse when zoomed" test
- Now uses the standard timeout configuration

### Test Structure Improvements
- All new unit tests are deterministic and don't rely on timing
- Unit tests run independently of browser/UI concerns
- Clear test organization with `describe` blocks for related tests

## GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`) with three jobs:

### 1. Test Job
- **Matrix Testing:** Runs tests on Node.js versions 14.x, 16.x, and 18.x
- **Browser Support:** Uses GitHub-hosted runners with Chrome pre-installed
- **CI-Optimized Config:** Puppeteer configured with `--no-sandbox` and headless mode for CI
- **Artifact Upload:** Saves test results and coverage data
- **Triggers:** Runs on PRs and pushes to main/master branches

### 2. Lint Job (Code Quality)
- Checks for existence of lint script
- Runs linter if available
- Continues even if no linter is configured (with informative message)

### 3. Coverage Job
- Runs tests with coverage reporting
- Uploads coverage artifacts for 30-day retention
- Provides visibility into code coverage metrics

### Workflow Features
- **Caching:** Uses npm cache for faster builds
- **Node 18.x:** Tests run on the latest stable LTS version
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Clear step names and output
- **Artifact Retention:** Test results kept for 7 days, coverage for 30 days
- **CI Best Practices:** Puppeteer runs in headless mode with proper sandbox flags

### Puppeteer CI Configuration

The workflow follows best practices for running Puppeteer in CI environments:

1. **No Manual Dependencies:** GitHub-hosted runners come with Chrome pre-installed
2. **Headless Mode:** Explicitly enabled for faster, more stable tests
3. **Security Flags:** Uses `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` for containerized environments
4. **Memory Optimization:** Uses `--disable-dev-shm-usage` to prevent shared memory issues
5. **GPU Disabled:** Uses `--disable-gpu` as GPU is not needed in CI

These settings are standard for Puppeteer in CI and are used by thousands of projects.

## Test Statistics

### Before Changes
- **Total Tests:** 2 unit tests, ~15 integration tests
- **Test Timeout:** 95 seconds
- **CI/CD:** None
- **Coverage:** Untested methods existed

### After Changes
- **Total Tests:** 29 unit tests, ~15 integration tests (44 total)
- **Test Timeout:** 60 seconds
- **CI/CD:** Full GitHub Actions workflow with matrix testing
- **Coverage:** All core Board and LocalDatastore methods tested

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Increased Confidence:** 27 new unit tests provide immediate feedback on core functionality
2. **Faster Development:** Unit tests run quickly without browser overhead
3. **Better Refactoring Support:** Comprehensive tests make refactoring safer
4. **Automated Quality Checks:** PR checks catch issues before merge

### Long-term Benefits
1. **Maintainability:** Clear test coverage makes codebase easier to maintain
2. **Regression Prevention:** Tests prevent reintroduction of fixed bugs
3. **Documentation:** Tests serve as executable documentation
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Matrix testing ensures compatibility

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### Test Stability
1. Review timing-dependent tests in `ui.spec.js` for potential flakiness
2. Consider replacing `thingsSettleDown()` magic numbers with more reliable synchronization
3. Add retry logic for known-flaky UI tests

### Test Coverage
1. Add tests for error paths in network operations
2. Test concurrent operations (multiple stickies being moved simultaneously)
3. Add performance benchmarks for rendering operations

### CI/CD Enhancements
1. Add code coverage percentage requirements
2. Add performance regression testing
3. Consider adding visual regression testing for UI
4. Add automatic dependency updates (Dependabot/Renovate)

### Code Quality
1. Add ESLint configuration for consistent code style
2. Add Prettier for automatic code formatting
3. Consider adding TypeScript for better type safety
4. Add pre-commit hooks to run tests locally

## Files Modified

2. **jest.config.js** - Reduced testTimeout from 95000ms to 60000ms
3. **test/ui.spec.js** - Removed arbitrary timeout from one test
4. **.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml** - New comprehensive CI/CD workflow
5. **jest-puppeteer.config.js** - Added CI-optimized Puppeteer configuration
6. **test/pages/starter-content.html** - Fixed import paths for LocalDatastore and render-to-dom
7. **test/pages/empty-scrollable.html** - Fixed import paths for LocalDatastore and render-to-dom

## Testing the Changes

To run the new tests:
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm test -- board.spec.js   # Run only unit tests
```

The tests will run automatically on all pull requests via GitHub Actions.
