# Separate Color State Implementation

## Overview
Implemented separate color state properties for stickies and connectors to allow independent color memory for each content type. This enhancement allows users to maintain different "current colors" for stickies and connectors simultaneously.

## New Color Properties

### App State Structure
```javascript
ui: {
  currentColor: "khaki", // Legacy - kept for backward compatibility
  currentStickyColor: "khaki", // Current color for new stickies
  currentConnectorColor: "#000000", // Current color for new connectors
  // ... other properties
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. App State (`scripts/app-state.js`)
- Added `currentStickyColor` and `currentConnectorColor` properties
- Kept `currentColor` for backward compatibility
- Default values: sticky color = "khaki", connector color = "#000000"

### 2. Connector Creation (`scripts/board-items/connector-events.js`)
- Updated connector creation to use `appState.ui.currentConnectorColor`
- Connectors now remember their own color state independently

### 3. Sticky Creation (`scripts/ui/render-to-dom.js`)
- Updated sticky creation to use `appState.ui.currentStickyColor`
- Stickies now remember their own color state independently

### 4. Menu Sync Logic (`scripts/ui/menu.js`)
- Updated `syncSelectorsWithSelection()` to sync appropriate colors:
  - Selected sticky → updates `currentStickyColor`
  - Selected connector → updates `currentConnectorColor`
- Color preview shows appropriate color based on selection
- Color change handler uses appropriate current color based on selection

### 5. Color Management (`scripts/ui/color-management.js`)
- Enhanced `changeColor()` function to update appropriate color properties
- When only stickies selected → updates `currentStickyColor`
- When only connectors selected → updates `currentConnectorColor`
- When both selected → updates both colors
- When nothing selected → updates both colors for future items

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Single `currentColor` shared between stickies and connectors
- Selecting a sticky would change the color for future connectors
- Selecting a connector would change the color for future stickies
- No memory of separate color preferences

### After
- Separate color memory for stickies and connectors
- Selecting a sticky only affects sticky color memory
- Selecting a connector only affects connector color memory
- Users can maintain different color preferences for each content type
- Color preview shows appropriate color based on current selection

## Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: Independent Color Memory
1. Create a red sticky → `currentStickyColor` = "red"
2. Create a blue connector → `currentConnectorColor` = "blue"
3. Create another sticky → it will be red (not blue)
4. Create another connector → it will be blue (not red)

### Scenario 2: Selection Sync
1. Select a yellow sticky → `currentStickyColor` = "yellow"
2. Select a green connector → `currentConnectorColor` = "green"
3. Color preview shows appropriate color based on selection
4. Color cycling works independently for each type

### Scenario 3: Mixed Selection
1. Select both a sticky and connector
2. Color changes affect both selected items
3. Both `currentStickyColor` and `currentConnectorColor` are updated
4. Color preview shows sticky color as primary

## Files Modified
- `scripts/app-state.js` - Added separate color properties
- `scripts/board-items/connector-events.js` - Use connector color for creation
- `scripts/ui/render-to-dom.js` - Use sticky color for creation and initialization
- `scripts/ui/menu.js` - Updated sync logic and color preview
- `scripts/ui/color-management.js` - Enhanced color change logic
- `test/connector.spec.js` - Updated test app state
- `test/event-handling.spec.js` - Updated test app state
- `test/image.spec.js` - Updated test app state

## Backward Compatibility
- `currentColor` property maintained for legacy compatibility
- All existing functionality continues to work
- Gradual migration path for any dependent code

## Testing
- Updated test files to include new color properties
- All existing tests should continue to pass
- New behavior can be tested by:
  1. Creating stickies and connectors with different colors
  2. Selecting different items and observing color preview changes
  3. Verifying independent color memory for each content type
